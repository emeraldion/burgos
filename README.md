# burgos-ux

Front-end for project Burgos. Project Burgos is the codename for the [Shared Battery Data Archive](http://burgos.emeraldion.it/mbl/).

I'm planning a major overhaul to convert it from a custom AJAX architecture to a React-based front-end with isomorphic rendering.

# Architecture

- React for UI components
- Flux for data flow
- d3 for SVG graphics
